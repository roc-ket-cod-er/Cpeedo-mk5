Bike speed detection!!!!

## About

As the main goal is to measure speed, it obviously does so.

In addition, it also supports: a cell connection; anti-theft features, including using that cell connection to send the bike's position to the internet; a double LCD + bonus E-INK display, for live speed (etc) monitoring; two independent ways of measuring speed: a wheel rotation counter + GPS; an SD card; and most importantly, features for live navigation.
